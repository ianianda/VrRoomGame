# VrRoomGame
A VR room game with Hololens for fun 

Acquired knowledgement from this project:
- Made assets using Blender. Yes, the whole office including the windows, doors, are made by myself. You can check another repository on my git to checkout more awesome blender works by me. (Such a talent programmer)
- Exported and imported assets from Blender to Unity.
- Deployed project as a VR game.
- Worked with C# scripts and other built-in methods, such as x,y,z transform in 3D environment, to control gravity and movement.

To be improved:
- may add more functions, such as objects collection from drawers and tables (already finished the assets), to make it as an escape game.
